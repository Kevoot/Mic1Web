# Mic1 Emulator in Web Assembly

Simulates the mic1 architecture in a web browser using WebAssembly. 


# Current Status

Input is only based on included files, will need to transition to a file selector. Output only outputs after 'q' is entered, so user operates blind for now.

# How to run

emrun test.html is one option. Serving the page on localhost should work no matter what. Tested in Chrome only.
